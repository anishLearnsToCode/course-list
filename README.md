# List of Courses
The following is a comprehensive guide of all the courses that I have successfully completed 
during university and also on other platforms such as Coursera, Udemy etc. Here successful
completion can refer to passing the course in University and Coursera or simply going through
all the video content and assignments on Udemy.

It must also be mentioned that official courses are just one way of learning so this list doesn't
and can not holistically summarize my knowledge areas as one learns from many facets rather than 
just certified courses.
